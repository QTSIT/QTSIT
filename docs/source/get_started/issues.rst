Known Issues & Limitations
--------------------------

Broken features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A small number of qtsit features are known to be broken. The qtsit team 
will either fix or deprecate these broken features. It is impossible to 
know of every possible bug in a large project like qtsit, but we hope to 
save you some headache by listing features that we know are partially or completely 
broken.

*Note: This list is likely to be non-exhaustive. If we missed something, 
please let us know [here](https://github.com/QTSIT/qtsit/issues/).*



Experimental features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

qtsit features usually undergo rigorous code review and testing to ensure that 
they are ready for production environments. The following qtsit features have not 
been thoroughly tested to the level of other qtsit modules, and could be 
potentially problematic in production environments.
